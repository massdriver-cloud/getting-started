# Step 3: Creating Your Own Bundle

This directory contains an existing Terraform module that you'll convert into a Massdriver bundle, demonstrating how to adopt Massdriver with your existing infrastructure code:

- Using the CLI to convert an existing Terraform module into Massdriver bundle
- Enhancing parameter schemas with validation and better UX
- Leveraging Massdriver metadata for contextual values
- Creating user-friendly forms with enums, validation, and defaults
- Building better user experiences through schema design

## Follow the Guide

This step is designed to be used with our comprehensive documentation:

**ðŸ“– [Step 3: Creating Your Own Bundle](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/getting-started/creating-bundles)**

The guide will walk you through converting an existing Terraform module into a Massdriver bundle, enhancing it with rich validation and user-friendly configuration options.

## What You'll Create

Starting with an existing Terraform module, you'll create a polished Massdriver bundle with:
- Enhanced parameter validation and user-friendly titles
- Dropdown menus for constrained choices (regions, key lengths)
- Smart defaults that promote security and best practices
- Resource naming using Massdriver metadata instead of manual inputs

Perfect for learning how to convert your own infrastructure modules!
